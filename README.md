**Modula Mojito** is a great theme for [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) made by [Modula](http://www.modula.fi).

Modula has [not been able to maintain the theme](http://www.modula.fi/2011/something-obsolete-and-something-new/) through to the latest versions of Redmine, so this repository takes the [last published version from Modula](http://www.modula.fi/2009/redmine-theme-modula-mojito/) (September 7th, 2009) and adds a few improvements.

Contributions and improvements via GitHub are most welcome, to be able to maintain compatiblity with the latest versions of Redmine (and now, [ChiliProject](https://www.chiliproject.org)).

_You should also check [Modula Martini](https://github.com/bevanr/martini), another discontinued theme from being maintained by [Bevan Rudge](https://github.com/bevanr)._
